      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Amir Banks, an aspiring coder based in Seattle,
        Washington. With a passion for technology and a drive to make a positive
        impact,
      </p>
      <p>
        I've dedicated my career to improving the performance of organizations
        that serve thousands of individuals each year.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey in the professional world has equipped me with a diverse
        skill set and a wealth of experience. From my time as a Lab Technician
        at Fastest Labs in Tacoma to my role as a Telecommunications Tech at
        AT&T in Puyallup, I've honed my abilities in website development,
        information security, and technical support.
      </p>
      <p>
        But my story doesn't stop there. As a Sales Associate at H&M in Olympia
        and Assistant Manager at Ausum Vapor in Lacey, I've cultivated
        leadership skills and a keen eye for promoting high-quality services and
        programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My educational background includes training in facilities maintenance
        from Columbia Basin Job Corps, where I completed coursework in various
        trades. Additionally, I hold a High School Diploma from Bartlett High in
        Anchorage, Alaska.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proficient in a range of software and tools, including MS Word,
        WordPress, Salesforce, and more, I'm always eager to learn and adapt to
        new technologies. With a career history of training and supervising
        staff, promoting adherence to organizational policies, and leading
        projects to success, I'm ready to take on new challenges and make a
        meaningful contribution to the world of coding and digital innovation.
      </p>
